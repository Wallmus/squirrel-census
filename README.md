# It's Squirrel Time
Reasons for this readme file:
* Just testing how how they show up on github
* Making sure the formatting does what I think it would
* Customizing things is fun

[Trolley Problems tester link](https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/)<br />
I hope the link above works.
* if it doesn't, it's my fault because
1. didn't research hard enough about formatting a readme file
2. didn't believe in myself
3. breathed on the computer wrong
